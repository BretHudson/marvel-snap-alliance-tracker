# Marvel Snap Alliance Tracker

This was a weekend project built with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to help my [Marvel Snap Alliance](https://www.marvelsnap.com/home/newsdetail?id=7389829092880734981) keep track of who has been active. None of the Marvel Snap clients allow you to see historical data, but it is captured in a file the game saves to appdata.
